He rates the pain intensity as 6/10 on a numerical scale. The headache is not alleviated by rest and is occasionally accompanied by dizziness, especially upon sudden position changes. He denies any recent head trauma, vision changes, or other focal neurological symptoms.\n\nPast Medical History:\n\n    Hypertension, diagnosed in 2010, controlled with medication (lisinopril 20 mg daily)\n    Allergies: None known\n    Surgeries: Appendectomy in 1995\n    Medications: Lisinopril, as mentioned; no other regular medications\n\nFamily History:\n\n    Father: Hypertension\n    Mother: Type 2 diabetes\n    No family history of neurological disorders\n\nSocial History:\nMr. Doe is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol occasionally. He denies any recreational drug use. He is married with two children and works as an accountant.\n\nReview of Systems:\nUnremarkable except for the aforementioned headache and dizziness.\n\nPhysical Examination:\n\n    Vital Signs: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 98.6\u00b0F\n    General: Well-nourished, well-developed, and in no acute distress\n    Head and Neck: Normocephalic, atraumatic; pupils equal and reactive to light; extraocular movements intact; fundoscopic exam within normal limits\n    Neurological: Cranial nerves II-XII intact; motor strength and sensation normal in all extremities; gait and coordination normal\n\nDiagnostic Studies:\n\n    Complete Blood Count (CBC): Within normal limits\n    Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP): Within normal limits\n    Head CT scan: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities\n\nAssessment and Plan:\nThe patient's headache and dizziness appear to be of primary origin. Given the absence of focal neurological deficits and the normal imaging studies, a primary headache disorder, such as tension-type headache or migraine, is suspected. The patient will be advised to keep a headache diary, including triggers and patterns. If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation may include neuroimaging and consultation with a neurologist.\n\nFollow-up in 2 weeks for symptom review and consideration of additional interventions if necessary.\n\nDr. [Your Name], MD\n[Your Medical License Number]\n[Date]\nSummary: Patient Information:\n\n    Name: John Doe\n    DOB: January 15, 1980\n    Sex: Male\n    Address: 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA\n    Occupation: Accountant\n    Referring Physician: Dr. Jane Smith\n\nChief Complaint:\nPersistent headache and occasional dizziness for one week.\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\nDull, continuous frontal-temporal headache (6/10 intensity), occasional dizziness.
